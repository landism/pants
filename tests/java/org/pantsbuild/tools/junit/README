Testing ConsoleRunner and other classes in src/java/org/pantsbuild/junit
is non-trivial because of bootstrapping issues. It should become somewhat easier
in the future, but in the mean time, here are the steps one needs to perform
if they change anything under src/java/org/pantsbuild/junit:

I.) On the dev branch:
1) Create a self-contained binary
$ ./pants binary src/java/org/pantsbuild/tools/junit:main

2) Edit junit.py to pick up the self-contained binary you created in 1,
so that the end result looks like (modulo the exact path to the binary jar you created in 1):

$$ git diff
diff --git a/src/python/pants/backend/jvm/subsystems/junit.py b/src/python/pants/backend/jvm/subsystems/junit.py

As you edit the source files, just repeat step 1 and the change will be picked up.

II.) Revert the change made in I-2 above, mark with @Ignore the tests that rely on
code changes in the runner (or the entire test class), and submit changes from I
to master

# TODO(John Sirois): Fix the publishing advice once publishing is sussed.
# See: https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/issues/1361
III.) The operation below should be done on MASTER. Publish a jar with:

1) git checkout master; git pull

2) dry run:
./pants clean-all publish src/java/org/pantsbuild/tools/junit

3) looks ok? do it:
yes | ./pants publish.jar --no-dryrun src/java/org/pantsbuild/tools/junit

IV.) Switch back to a dev branch. Make a change that bumps the revision number in BUILD.tools and
un-@Ignores any tests temporarily ignored in step I.
